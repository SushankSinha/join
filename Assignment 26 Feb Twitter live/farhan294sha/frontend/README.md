# Vite React pnpm Setup

This project was bootstrapped with Vite, React, and pnpm.


1.  **Install dependencies using pnpm:**

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

## Development

1.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```

    This will start the Vite development server, and you can access the application at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is already in use).

## Building for Production

1.  **Build the application for production:**

    ```bash
    pnpm run build
    ```

    This will create an optimized production build in the `dist` directory.
